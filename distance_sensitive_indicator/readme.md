# Distance Sensitive Indicator (improper title: The Goldie Lox Machine)

This contraption basically senses an object with an Ultrasonic sensor, when the object is deemed to far, it displays the caption ` TOO FAR ` message (along with some custom text manip), when the object is detected to be too close, it will display ` TOO CLOSE ` and at the sweet spot (hence the name) it will display a success message along with a low-medium frequency buzzing from a passive buzzer.

Here's a small showcase:

This is my first legitmate arduino project. ( Wrote my own code, wired it up my own way, learned a ton)
